# P1_UAV_TELLO

In this project, we are trying to make a Tello drone fly autonomously ðŸ›¸.

The scripts are in the folder Final_scripts. In there, they are separated in two additional folders, namely 'Client PC' which is where all the scripts that run on your PC are, and 'Pico W' where all the microPython scripts from the Pico W are located.

The html file in Client PC shows a map of RSSI values marked as circles on simulated GPS coordinates with aproximately 1 meter between them.
